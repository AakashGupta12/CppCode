I am writing the details of the changes that I want in media.cpp. The reason is, so that more logic is put and we can see how objects interact with each other etc.

Media class---------------------
it will have title and price attributes
it will have an array of BaseMedia objects, say baseMediaArr (of type BaseMedia)
it will have a method addBaseMedia(BaseMedia) to add such objects in the array
it will have a display() non virtual method to display all such basemedia object
inside display(), it will first print title and price, then for each object in array (of type BaseMedia), it will call displayBaseMedia() for that object

BaseMedia will be a virtual class---------
it will have virtual method displayBaseMedia()
Book and Tape both will be its subclasses and will be implementing displayBaseMedia()

Book:BaseMedia---------
displayBaseMedia () - it will print pages

Tape:BaseMedia------------
displayBaseMedia () - it will print time

in the main()------------
it will create a Media object, passing it title and price
it will create Book object passing it just the page parameter and add it in media using addBaseMedia
it will create Tape object passing it just the time parameter and add it in media using addBaseMedia

then it will call display on media object, which in turn will be calling displayBaseMedia() for Book and Tape objects
